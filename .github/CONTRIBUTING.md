My name is Rodney. I am a keen developer interested in security and online privacy. I also love building accessible sites in Gatsby. I am equally keen to hear your suggestions for improving this project. Thanks for your interest in the project. Could I ask you to take a look at the project's Code of Conduct before continuing with your contribution? Thanks! A good starting point for getting up-to-speed on the project is the README file.
